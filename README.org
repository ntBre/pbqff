* Usage
** Linear molecules
*** SICs
   - LIN1 coordinates must be used instead of LINX/LINY
   - Two LIN1 coordinates must be used for each X/Y pair. The code will detect
     these pairs based on their shared central atoms and add two dummy atoms per
     pair, one along each axis perpendicular to the principal axis of the
     molecule

* Tasks [4/12]
** WAIT parse input - for now no processing
   - initial geometry
   - opt bool
   - path to spectro
** DONE optimize geometry (if requested)
** DONE read out optimized geometry
** DONE parse intder template header
   - easy with Intder::load_file
** TODO run taylor.py to generate disps and anpass
*** DONE write taylor.py
*** TODO determine symmetries of coordinates
    - [ ] determine point group of molecule
    - [ ] run one disp of each coord
    - [ ] determine symmetry of each displacement
*** TODO sort disps by irrep
    - implement cmp::Ordering (I think) on Irrep to call sort, probably on a
      vector of tuples (coord_number, irrep)
*** TODO call taylor code
** TODO run intder to get disps
   - combine
     1. template header
     2. taylor disps
     3. optimized geometry
** TODO build and run points
** TODO run anpass
** TODO intder_geom
** TODO intder freqs
** TODO call out to spectro

* Improvements
** TODO make =Mopac::new= take a template
   - hard-coding the template for now, but eventually I want to be able to read
     in a template like the Go version. this will propagate to rust-semp, but
     there I can use a const template for the whole program
** TODO warn if directories exist and say to use overwrite flag

     first number I got when sorting SICs: 563.6696

     I get 558.7015 with the re-alignment whether or not I sort the irreps

     I can reproduce the old results without sorting the irreps and without
     re-alignment

     DONE reproduce with +sort irreps, -alignment

     DONE +sort irreps, +sort sics, -alignment

     both of the above reproduce the old results, issue still seems to be the
     alignment

     TODO suspect this is the issue. I'm sorting the irreps I pass to taylor
     but I'm not sorting the SICs themself

     the better alternative is probably to pass lists instead of ranges to
     taylor so I don't have to sort them at all

     TODO try not sorting the irreps at all, that should have the same effect
     as not doing the symm stuff if this is the issue.

     TODO `make_taylor_checks` does use irrep.0. if the ranges aren't
     consecutive, who knows what it's even doing. That would be interesting to
     find out
