the problem is I have three things
1. symmetry-equivalent structures
2. force constants those comprise (indices in fc array)
3. individual energies

to avoid having to change psqs to account for symmetry, I can just keep a map of
structures to energies and drain into an energy array, just like SICs. this has
the disadvantage of keeping track of all the energies as we go, but I think
that's not too big of a deal.

#+begin_src rust
  let map = HashMap<Structure, Target>::new();

  struct Target {
      energy: Option<f64>,
      source_index: usize, // into the energy array drain is called on
      indices: Vec<(f64, usize)>, // index into the fc array with a coefficient
  }
#+end_src

=source_index= is an increasing counter and =indices= come from code I already have.
if the structure is in the map, push an index to its result; else

#+begin_src rust
  if let Some(result) = map.get(structure) {
      result.indices.push((coeff, index));
  } else {
      map.insert(
	  structure,
	  Target {
	      energy: None,
	      source_index: counter,
	      indices: vec![(coeff, index)],
	  },
      );
      counter += 1;
  }
#+end_src

all of the actual symmetry accounting can be hidden in my own Hash
implementation

#+begin_src rust
  struct Structure {
      // not sure what fields, whatever `symm` operates on, a Molecule? could just
      // be a tuple struct in that case
  }

  impl Hash for Structure {
      // ensure that symmetry-equivalent structures hash the same
  }
#+end_src

in the case that I'm using too much memory, just flush the hash map by pushing
all of the Targets in the hashmap to the fc array and emptying the map
